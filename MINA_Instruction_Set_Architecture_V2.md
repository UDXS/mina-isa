## **Introduction**

MINA is an *open* instruction set architecture (ISA) designed to be flexible and extendable.

Current and future goals include:
* an ISA suitable for hardware implementation
* division, floating-point and vector extensions
* opcode space for custom instruction set extensions
* 32-bit and 64-bit address space variants.

***

### **1.1 ISA Overview**

The MINA ISA is defined as a base integer ISA with optional division, floating-point, vector and user defined instruction extensions. The two base integer ISAs are **MINA32** (32-bit address space) and **MINA64** (planned 64-bit address space variant).

One of the two base integer ISAs must be present in any implementation.

***

### **1.2 Exceptions And Interrupts**

The MINA ISA defines two runtime events: *exceptions* and *interrupts*.

Exceptions are events that occur *synchronously* to the current MINA thread. They transfer control to an exception handler.

Interrupts are events that occur *asynchronously* to the current MINA thread. They transfer control to an exception handler at the end of the currently executing instruction.

All types of exceptions that can be generated by instructions are described in the detailed instruction description sections in this ISA manual.

### **1.3 Data Types**

The MINA ISA currently defines the following data types:
* **Byte** (8-bit)
* **Halfword** (16-bit)
* **Word** (32-bit)
* **Longword** (64-bit).

***

### **1.4 System Registers**

The MINA ISA defines a word addressable 12-bit address space for special purpose registers called *system registers* (SR). Programmers can access SRs with the `MTS` (Move To System) and `MFS` (Move From System) instructions.

The following addresses are currently defined:
```
000h | CPUID_L (CPU IDentification Lo)
001h | CPUID_H (CPU IDentification Hi)
010h | EBA     (Exception Base Address)
012h | EPC     (Exception Program Counter)
014h | EMA     (Exception Memory Address)
```

Addresses <= 7FFh are reserved, addresses >= 800h are implementation defined.
